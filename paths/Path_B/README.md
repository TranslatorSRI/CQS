## Path B

Path B is intended to run from a biolink:Disease input CURIE related to a rare pulmonary disease (or any disease) through biolink:Tissue and biolink:Gene enriched in those tissues, targeting and leveraging CHP's gene-tissue enricher functionality, to biolink:Drug, SmallMolecule and then to biolink:DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature by way of clinical KPs, using predicates biolink:correlated_with and biolink:associated_with_increased(decreased)_likelihood_of plus _allowlist_ parameters.
