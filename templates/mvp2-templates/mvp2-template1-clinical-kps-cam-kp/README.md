**README**

The mvp2-template1-clinical-kps-cam-kp folder template is responsive to inferred chemical - up/downregulates - gene assertions. Specifically, the TRAPI query is represented as a two-hop, in which the first hop seeks chemicals (i.e., drugs or exposures) that are associated with diseases (i.e., diagnoses) in real-world observational evidence derived from the clinical KPs (cohd, icees, multiomics-ehrmla-kp); the second hop then seeks genes that are causally related to those chemicals, leveraging the clinical knowledge provided by cam-kp.
